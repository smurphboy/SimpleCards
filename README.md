# Simple Cards

## TL;DR

A simple package that plays cards... 

## Intro

A pacakge that creates and manages decks of cards, hands and poker style scoring of hands. This can be used as a the basis of many card games.

## Plans

The major goal is to create a card based game that simulates football (think Balatro for soccer) but intially it will be used to make a simple poker game or rummy clone.
